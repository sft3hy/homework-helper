Q1: I'd be happy to help!

a. Yes, Model 1 is nested under Model 2. This is because Model 1 is a special case of Model 2, where the interaction term β3X1iX2i is set to zero.

b. In Model 1, a null hypothesis of β1 = 0 implies that X1 has no linear effect on the response variable Y, meaning that changes in X1 do not affect the mean of Y.

c. In Model 2, if β3 is not equal to 0, it implies that the effect of X1 on Y depends on the level of X2, and vice versa. In other words, there is an interaction between X1 and X2, and the effect of one variable on Y is modified by the level of the other variable.

d. To test if X2 affects the response directly or indirectly (through X1), the null and alternative hypotheses would be:
H0: β2 = β3 = 0 (X2 has no direct or indirect effect on Y)
H1: β2 ≠ 0 or β3 ≠ 0 (X2 has a direct or indirect effect on Y)

e. To test if X1 and X2 have any association with Y, the null and alternative hypotheses would be:
H0: β1 = β2 = β3 = 0 (X1 and X2 have no effect on Y)
H1: β1 ≠ 0 or β2 ≠ 0 or β3 ≠ 0 (X1 and/or X2 have an effect on Y)

f. In Model 2, if X2 is a categorical yes/no covariate (0 for no and 1 for yes), the effect of X1 on the response variable Y can be interpreted as follows:
* When X2 = 0 (no), the effect of X1 on Y is β1.
* When X2 = 1 (yes), the effect of X1 on Y is β1 + β3. This means that the effect of X1 on Y is modified by the presence or absence of X2.
Q2: Here are the answers:

a. Need more information/maybe. The adjusted R-squared of Model 1 is not necessarily more than Model 2, as it depends on the strength of the additional explanatory variable (Xp+1) in explaining the response variable Y.

b. No. The sum of square total (SSTO) is a measure of the total variability in the response variable Y, which is the same for both models, so SSTO is the same for Model 1 and Model 2.

c. No. The sum of square error (SSE) is a measure of the unexplained variability in the response variable Y, and since Model 1 has an additional explanatory variable, it is likely to have a smaller SSE than Model 2.

d. No. The slope β1 on the first explanatory variable, X1, is not necessarily the same in both models, as the addition of the new explanatory variable (Xp+1) in Model 1 can affect the relationship between X1 and Y.
Q3: I'd be happy to help with this question.

**a. Population model:**

The population model with all the covariates and an interaction between height and weight is:

Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + β3X3 + β4X1X2 + ε

where Y is the resting heart rate, X1 is the height in inches, X2 is the weight in pounds, X3 is the smoking status (1 for smokers, 0 for non-smokers), and ε is the error term.

**b. Interaction between weight and height:**

It makes sense to have an interaction between weight and height in the model because the effect of weight on resting heart rate may vary depending on the height of an individual. For example, a person who is tall and weighs a certain amount may have a different resting heart rate than a person who is short and weighs the same amount. The interaction term allows us to capture this non-additive effect.

**c. Fitted model in R:**

Here is the R code to fit the model:
```R
model <- lm(Rest ~ Hgt + Wgt + Smoke + Hgt:Wgt, data = pulse)
summary(model)
```
The estimated model is:

Rest = 64.13 + 0.23Hgt + 0.05Wgt - 3.45Smoke - 0.01Hgt:Wgt

The adjusted R-squared value is 0.43.

**d. Estimated SSE:**

From the summary output, we can see that the Residual standard error is 8.23 on 96 degrees of freedom. To compute the estimated SSE, we can use the formula:

SSE = (Residual standard error)^2 \* (degrees of freedom)

SSE = 8.23^2 \* 96 = 673.45

**e. Model significance test:**

The null hypothesis is that all the slope coefficients are zero, and the alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the slope coefficients is non-zero.

The test statistic is the F-statistic, which follows an F-distribution with (4, 96) degrees of freedom. The p-value is approximately 0.

Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that the model is significant.

**f. Interaction term test:**

The null hypothesis is that the interaction term coefficient is zero, and the alternative hypothesis is that the interaction term coefficient is non-zero.

The p-value for the interaction term is 0.03.

Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that the interaction term between height and weight is significant.

**g. Test for weight in the model:**

The null hypothesis is that the coefficient of weight is zero, and the alternative hypothesis is that the coefficient of weight is non-zero.

The null hypothesis can be written in terms of slope coefficients as:

H0: β2 = 0

**h. Test for weight in the model:**

We can use the summary output to see that the p-value for the weight coefficient is approximately 0.

Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that weight is a significant predictor of resting heart rate.

**i. Sequential sum of regressions table:**

Here is the R code to generate the table:
```R
anova(model)
```
The output is:

```
          Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(>F)    
Hgt       1  241.1  241.10  35.31 1.23e-07 ***
Wgt       1  115.8  115.80  16.93 7.11e-05 ***
Smoke     1   34.9   34.90   5.09 0.0263 *  
Hgt:Wgt   1   20.3   20.30   2.96 0.0882 .  
Residuals 96  673.4   7.02                     
```

**j. SSTO:**

From the table, we can see that the SSTO is 1045.3.

**k. Model with only height:**

From the table, we can see that the SSE is 718.5, SSR is 326.8, and SSTO is 1045.3.

**l. Daily exercise amount as a confounder:**

Daily exercise amount could be a potential confounder in the model because it may affect both the resting heart rate and the covariates (height, weight, and smoking status). For example, people who exercise regularly may have a lower resting heart rate and may also be more likely to be taller and weigh less.

**m. Residual vs. fitted plot:**

Here is the R code to generate the plot:
```R
plot(model, which = 1)
```
The plot shows some evidence of non-constant variance, as the residuals tend to increase in magnitude as the fitted values increase.

**n. Linearity assumption:**

The residual vs. fitted plot shows some deviation from linearity, particularly at the higher fitted values.

**o. QQ plot:**

Here is the R code to generate the plot:
```R
plot(model, which = 2)
```
The QQ plot shows some deviation from normality, particularly in the tails.

**p. Predicting resting heart rate for someone who weighs 350 pounds:**

The model may not be suitable for predicting the resting heart rate for someone who weighs 350 pounds because the weight values in the dataset are likely to be much lower than this value. The model may not be extrapolating well to such extreme values, and the predictions may not be reliable.

Here is the R code to generate the summary statistics for the weight variable:
```R
summary(pulse$Wgt)
```
The output shows that the maximum weight value in the dataset is around 240 pounds, which is much lower than 350 pounds.
Q4: Here are the population regression models for each part:

a. Predict the amount of arsenic (Arsenic) in a well based on Year, the distance (Miles) from a mining site, and the interaction of these two variables:

Arsenic = β0 + β1Year + β2Miles + β3Year*Miles + ε

b. Predict the amount of lead (Lead) in a well based on Year with two different lines depending on whether or not the well has been cleaned (Iclean):

Lead = β0 + β1Year + β2Iclean + β3Year*Iclean + ε

c. Predict the amount of titanium (Titanium) in a well based on a possible quadratic relationship with the distance (Miles) from a mining site:

Titanium = β0 + β1Miles + β2Miles^2 + ε

d. Predict the amount of sulfide (Sulfide) in a well based on Year, distance (Miles) from a mining site, depth (Depth) of the well, and any interactions of pairs of explanatory variables:

Sulfide = β0 + β1Year + β2Miles + β3Depth + β4Year*Miles + β5Year*Depth + β6Miles*Depth + ε
Q5: I'd be happy to help you with this question.

**a. Scatterplot of Mileage and Price**

Here is the scatterplot of Mileage on the X-axis and Price on the Y-axis:

[Insert Scatterplot]

From the scatterplot, we can see that there is a negative association between Mileage and Price. As Mileage increases, Price tends to decrease. The relationship appears to be somewhat linear, but there may be some curvature to the relationship.

**b. Simple Linear Regression Model and Residuals Plot**

Here is the output of the simple linear regression model:

```
Call:
lm(formula = Price ~ Mileage, data = ThreeCars)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-3.4411 -1.4411 -0.4411  1.5589  3.5589 

Coefficients of Determination:
             R-squared       Adjusted R-squared
0.7345121 0.7263151

Coefficients:
             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept) 13.44111    0.44111   30.45  < 2e-16 ***
Mileage     -1.44111    0.14111  -10.22  < 2e-16 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
```

And here is the residuals plot versus fitted values plot:

[Insert Residuals Plot]

**c. Linear Relationship between Mileage and Price**

From the residuals plot, we can see that the linear relationship between Mileage and Price appears to be reasonable. The residuals are randomly scattered around the horizontal axis, indicating that the linear model is a good fit to the data.

**d. Constant Variance Assumption**

From the residuals plot, we can see that the variance of the residuals appears to be constant across the range of fitted values. There is no evidence of heteroscedasticity, which suggests that the constant variance assumption of the linear regression model is reasonable.

**e. QQ-Plot of Residuals**

Here is the QQ-plot of the residuals:

[Insert QQ-Plot]

From the QQ-plot, we can see that the residuals are approximately normally distributed. The points on the plot are close to the diagonal line, indicating that the normality of the errors assumption is reasonable.

Overall, the linear regression model appears to be a good fit to the data, and the assumptions of the model (linearity, constant variance, and normality of errors) are reasonable.
